# Liam Mack Snyder – Personal Website

This is my personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). When finished, it will showcase anything and everything I want it to including coding work and qualifications, and acting as a hub for my socials and resume.
