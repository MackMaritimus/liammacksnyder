### Liam Snyder – Personal Website 

This is my personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I made it to act as my personal online hub for professional life while giving me full customization over what I'm able to do.
