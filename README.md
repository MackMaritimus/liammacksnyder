# Liam Mack Snyder – Portfolio Site Code

This is my personal portfolio site, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). When finished, it will showcase my development work and design work for both of my majors, Computer Information Systems and Marketing, as well as coding and artwork/design work I've done outside of school.

## 🌐 Live Site
[liammacksnyder.vercel.app](https://liammacksnyder.vercel.app)

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Next.js** – Full-stack React framework for performant web app development
- **TypeScript** – Type-safe JavaScript for safer, more maintainable code
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling framework for quick UI development
- **Vercel** – Cloud platform for deployment and hosting

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This site is still under development. I began building it in May 2025, focusing first on frontend layout and responsive design. The buttons for design and coding work are currently either linked to websites or nonfunctional.

- “Coding Work” currently links to my GitHub archive repo
- “Design Work” is not yet active but will feature original artwork and design work

## 📂 Code Archive Repo (also WIP)
A public GitHub archive of my coursework and personal projects, currently including SQL. Java, Python, and React Native work will be added soon.
